# Federated_simCLR
 SimCLR is a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations.
 I federate a SimCLR model and train the server with 4 clients.
 The initial model has an accuracy of 80%.
 The federated model run with a non-IID dataset has a lesser accuracy of 75% and the model run with IID datasets have an accruacy of 82%.
